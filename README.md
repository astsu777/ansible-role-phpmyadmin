Ansible Role: PHPMyAdmin
=========

This role installs and configure PHPMyAdmin. Note that this particular role is depending on two others:
- [ansible-role-database](https://github.com/GSquad934/ansible-role-database)
- [ansible-role-webserver](https://github.com/GSquad934/ansible-role-webserver)


Once MariaDB and Nginx (from the two roles above) are up and running, this role performs the following actions:
- Install PHPMyAdmin
- Configure the PHPMyAdmin database and setup an administrative user
- Configure and enables a Website in Nginx to access PHPMyAdmin
- Configure HTTPS and generate certificates with Let's Encrypt (if FQDN of the Website can be resolved)
- If FQDN of the Website cannot be resolved, default SSL certificates are deployed


Requirements
------------

No specific requirements for this role.

Role Variables
--------------

Multiple variables are necessary in order to properly configure PHPMyAdmin.

Here is how they can be configured:

```
phpmyadmin_database: phpmyadmin
phpmyadmin_server_ip: localhost
phpmyadmin_user: phpmyadmin
phpmyadmin_password: MyPassword
phpmyadmin_client_ip: localhost
phpmyadmin_hostname: phpmyadmin.myserver.com
cerbot_email: myemail@email.com
```

The variables above can be configured as group_vars or host_vars. As far as the credentials are concerned, these should be kept in a separate secret vars_file encrypted with *ansible-vault*.

Dependencies
------------

This role depends on two other roles as stated above:
- [ansible-role-database](https://github.com/GSquad934/ansible-role-database)
- [ansible-role-webserver](https://github.com/GSquad934/ansible-role-webserver)


If you install this role via Ansible-Galaxy, the name of the roles are [*GSquad934.database*](https://github.com/GSquad934/ansible-role-database) and [*GSquad934.webserver*](https://github.com/GSquad934/ansible-role-webserver).


However, if you have MariaDB and Nginx installed, this role should still works if you adapt it.
